# Compiler App
**A compiler with syntactic, lexical, and semantic support for a specific programming language (see more [here](#about-language)) that compiles the code and generates an IL (Intermediate Language) file with the result.**

This project was developed during the Compilers course in the 4th semester of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science ([college](https://furb.br/)).

## Versions
This project was developed in 4 stages, evolving into its final version.

## <a name="about-language"></a>About the Programming Language
This project was developed to work with a language created specifically for the semester in which I studied the subject. You can learn more about the language in [this](./utils/semantic_specification.gals) file. I recommend opening it with [this](https://gals.sourceforge.net/) program for better viewing, but you can still understand it by viewing it in a default text editor.

## How to Execute

To execute this program, follow the steps below:

1. **Install .NET 8 SDK**: Ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Open the solution ([./CompiladorApp.sln](./CompiladorApp.sln)) in Visual Studio and execute the program**: Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio. Make sure you have Visual Studio 2022 or later installed.
